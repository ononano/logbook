# The Logbook Manifesto

## Politics/Ethos
### Anything Goes
### Openness/Transparency/Accountability
### Aim for an entry per day, respecting the period of sleep between days
### Coverage: life and the politics of post-post-millennial-internet being; yoga;


## Technicalities
### Use Git
### Host on darknets also
### Modularity/extensibility, Gatsby.js with Preact
### Tags!

## What Not
### Todo List - fucking boring - only include what you've DONE or are DOING
Your laundry and your fleeting ideas are of no interest. What's of interest is what you're doing and what you've done, direct experience.
